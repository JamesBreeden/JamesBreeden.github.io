      While the directory was the primary project, my attention was often pulled away to side projects.
      Being able to multitask is a crucial skill in a professional environment,
        and I believe that is what they were putting to the test with these tasks.

            <p>
              Being able to do the SharePoint updates gave me experience maintaining existing applications.
              Some of the updates were simple.
              Duplicate the page, archive the old one and update the new one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another simple update was adding additional files to a page.
              Upload it via drag/drop or through the file browser, whichever suits the situation.
              Then create the href on the page linking to the file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Others were not so simple.
              They either required changes to the styling or had some complicated modifications.
              While these presented a challenge,
                it was welcomed and overcome with some perseverance.

        <div class="accordion-section">
          <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-2">The Button</a>
          <div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">
            <p>
              This project was dubbed "The Button" because of how simple it seemed.
              When it began, it was a simple WinForm that had a single button.
              It developed into much more than that.
            </p>
            <p>
              What the team requested was a more secure way for the CCT team to access batch files.
              What I created was an application that can access the batch files, error checks, 
                and reports the result back to the user.
              If there were any errors,
                several events occur.
            </p>
            <p>
              First event is the error gets written to a .txt file on the support's server.
              Second event is the user is give the opportunity to communicate with support staff
                via a Yes/No dialog box.
              If the user selects yes, it will auto-populate an email with target, subject, 
                and content to be sent to support staff.
              If the user selects no, the program will go back to home screen without emailing support.
            </p>
            <p>
              The error checking not only makes sure the batch file was successful,
                but it also makes sure it exists.
              By validating the existance of the batch file,
                it helps with the user experience as well as helps support with troubleshooting.
            </p>
            <p>
              One final feature I added in was the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code">Konami Code</a>.
              I captured the key input from the keyboard, 
                and if it matched up to the required sequence, the text on the button would change.
              The text started out as a professional string such as "Execute Batch File,"
                but when the Konami Code is entered, the program access an external .txt file, reads in the lines,
                and uses a random number generator to select one of the lines and display it as the text on the button.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the .txt file are various quotes from many different sources.
              Some were from movies, some were from cartoons,
                and some were from around the office.
              All of this was done AFTER getting authorization ofcourse.

              One of the more... imaginative projects, was creating a golf putting practice target.
              Sometimes, to reset their brain and come with a different approach, a person needs a distraction.
              Using a cardboard box, scissors, and some clever thinking, I created a multi-target practice target to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doing this project served multiple purposes.
              The first was that now there is a way to practice putting.
              The second and more subtle lesson here was critical thinking.
              Coming up with the solution to a less than ordinary request
                got the brain working.

              In addition to these projects was also the occasional cake run.
              Being in the office environment,
                there were several birthdays that came around during my internship.
              I was tasked with getting the cake.
              As the intern, I felt a little pressure to make sure I got the right cake.
              If I were to return with the wrong cake, that would definitely become my signifier.
              There is still an intern known for his carrot cake debacle.

            <p>
              Over the summer, CNL hosted 2 team building exercises that I was able to be a part of.
              The first was BubbleSoccer. It was a blast!! <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCIT8d6lpqQ”>Here is a link</a> of it being played on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
              If you ever get a chance to play, I’d highly recommend it.
              Be warned though, it is deceptively exhausting.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second event was bowling at Splitsville in Disney. 
              Again, we had a blast and everyone had a great time.
              I actually won the award for highest score.
              No one was as surprised as I was.
            <p>

      <p>
        Taking into account all of the side projects and the directory,
          I had an amazing time at CNL and would do it again and again if I was given the chance to.
