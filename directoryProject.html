        First off, the primary task; to recreate the Associate Directory. What does this mean? 
        Basically, the current directory had an outdated interface, 
          the pathing doesn't flow how a user would want, 
          and the speed felt like it was a little lacking. 
        They requested a streamlined application that had a more modern feel and had an intuitive flow to the interaction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a team, we decided to use ASP.NET MVC architectural pattern in Visual Studio 2013 to create the new directory. 
        This will allow us to use a combination of C#, HTML5, Razor, and JavaScript/JQuery. 
        In order to enforce version control, we used Team Foundation Server, commonly known as TFS. 
        SSMS2012 was our got-to for maintaining a sandbox database that contained our test information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first goal was to determine the project scope.
        With that done, a better view of what needs to be created begins to form.
        We wanted to get the functionality ironed out, then we can apply styling to spice it up.
        As a team, we saw that there were several primary features to be used.
      </p>
      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion-section">
          <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-1">Search Feature</a>
          <div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">
            <p>
              There would be a search feature that uses a select query to get the user's requested information from the DB.
            </p>
          </div><!--end .accordion-section-content-->
        </div><!--end .accordion-section-->
        <div class="accordion-section">
          <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-2">Update Feature</a>
          <div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">
            <p>
              There would also be an update view that uses Active Directory to determine who is logged in.
              We can then use a select query with the logged-in user's ID as the target and 
                populate the model with the logged in users information.
              There are limitations to which fields users can update. 
              For instance, they can't change their start date, title, department, or some other values.
              For these values, we loaded them into labels.
              The values that we did allow them to update, such as the orginations they are involved in,
                any family members they wanted to list,
                or their education history,
                we loaded this information into textareas.
              This will allow the user to modify the content loaded.
              When we designed the layout for the body, 
                we created the textareas inside a using statement linked to the actionresult in our controller.
              This will allow us to 
              For usability, 
                we also wanted to add a reset button to this page for when the user doesn't like the changed information 
                and wants to reclaim the original values.
              This was a simple addition.
              Since the fields were created in the using statement, we just had to 
            </p>
          </div><!--end .accordion-section-content-->
        </div><!--end .accordion-section-->
        <div class="accordion-section">
          <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-3">Customized Phonelist Feature</a>
          <div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">
            <p>
              The third main feature we would be creating is the customized phonelist. 
              Using Active Directory, we can determine the logged in user, 
                query the DB for said user's personlized phonelist, 
                and display it in a useful format.
            </p>
          </div><!--end .accordion-section-content-->
        </div><!--end .accordion-section-->
        <div class="accordion-section">
          <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-4">Admin Feature</a>
          <div id="accordion-4" class="accordion-section-content">
            <p>
              Similar to the "User Update" page and the personalized phonelist, we use Active Directory
                and display the admin link if said logged in user is classified as an admin.
              The admin view would be similar to the update view.
              It would have the same behavior as far as updating information,
                it would just be able to update all the fields,
                as well as upload a new profile image.
              </p>
              <p>
              A feature that will need to be created for the administrator is adding a new record to the DB.
              So far, we have used the view to modify an existing record.
              I created the "Create New User" form in a using statement that was linked to the same ActionResult as the
                "Update Record" form, however the submit button would send back a different value, 
                causing an If statement to modify the behavior slightly.
              This will allow us to re-use a lot of code, which is always a good thing.
