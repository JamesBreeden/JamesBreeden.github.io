        First off, the primary task; to recreate the Associate Directory. What does this mean? 
        Basically, the current directory had an outdated interface, 
          the pathing doesn't flow how a user would want, 
          and the speed felt like it was a little lacking. 
        They requested a streamlined application that had a more modern feel and had an intuitive flow to the interaction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a team, we decided to use ASP.NET MVC architectural pattern in Visual Studio 2013 to create the new directory. 
        This will allow us to use a combination of C#, HTML5, Razor, and JavaScript/JQuery. 
        In order to enforce version control, we used Team Foundation Server, commonly known as TFS. 
        SSMS2012 was our got-to to maintain a sandbox database that contained our test information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first goal was to determine the project scope.
        With that done, a better view of what needs to be created begins to form.
        We wanted to get the functionality ironed out, then we can apply styling to spice it up.
        As a team, we saw that there were several primary functions to be used.
      </p>
      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion-section">
          <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-1">Search Feature</a>
          <div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">
            <p>
              There would be a search feature that uses a select query to get the user's requested information from the DB.
            </p>
          </div><!--end .accordion-section-content-->
        </div>
        <!--end .accordion-section-->
        <div class="accordion-section">
          <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-2">Update Feature</a>
          <div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">
            <p>
              There would also be an update view that populated textareas with the logged in users information, 	
                allows them to change said information, 
                and then send an update query back to the DB with the modified information.
              For usability, 
                we also wanted to add a reset button to this page for when the user doesn't like the changed information 
                and wants to reclaim the original values.
            </p>

        <div class="accordion-section">
          <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-3">Customized Phonelist Feature</a>
          <div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">
            <p>
              The third main feature we would be creating is the customized phonelist. 
              Using Active Directory, determine the logged in user, 
                query the DB for said user's personlized phonelist, 
                and display it in a useful format.
