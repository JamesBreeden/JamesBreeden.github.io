        First off, the primary task; to recreate the Associate Directory. What does this mean? Basically, their current 
        directory has an outdated interface, the pathing doesn't flow how a user would want, and the speed felt like it was 
        a little lacking. They wanted a streamlined application that had a more modern feel and had an intuitive flow 
        to the interaction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We decided to use ASP.NET MVC architectural pattern in Visual Studio 2013 to create their new Directory. 
        This will allow us to use a combination of C#, HTML5, Razor, and JavaScript/JQuery. In order to enforce version 
        control, we used Team Foundation Server, commonly known as TFS. SSMS2012 was our got-to to maintain a sandbox database
        that contained our test information.
