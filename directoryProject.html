      <p>
        First off, the primary task; to recreate the Associate Directory. What does this mean? 
        Basically, the current directory had an outdated interface, 
          the pathing doesn't flow how a user would want, 
          and the speed felt like it was a little lacking. 
        They requested a streamlined application that had a more modern feel and had an intuitive flow to the interaction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a team, we decided to use ASP.NET MVC architectural pattern in Visual Studio 2013 to create the new directory. 
        This will allow us to use a combination of C#, HTML5, Razor, and JavaScript/JQuery. 
        In order to enforce version control, we used Team Foundation Server, commonly known as TFS. 
        SSMS2012 was our got-to for maintaining a sandbox database that contained our test information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first goal was to determine the project scope.
        With that done, a better view of what needs to be created begins to form.
        We wanted to get the functionality ironed out, then we can apply styling to spice it up.
        As a team, we saw that there were several primary features to be used.
      </p>
      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion-section">
          <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-1">Search Feature</a>
          <div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">
            <p>
              The first feature would be a search function that uses a select query 
                to get the user's requested information from the DB.
              We also wanted the user to be able to search from any view,
                so we created the search area in the _Layout.
              This would eliminate clicks and page loads, 
                making it feel like a more fluid experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user has 3 possible fields to search with; 
                first name, last name, and department.
              They can search with a single field, or any combination of the three.
              The first and last names are textarea inputs, 
                while the department is a dropdown list created dynamically by querying the DB.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wrapping these inputs in a using statement linking to its ActionResult
                sections it off so that the inputs cannot interfere with any other textareas.
              This problem seemed to only arise in very specific scenarios,
                but anytime the program breaks is not good.
            </p>
          </div><!--end .accordion-section-content-->
        </div><!--end .accordion-section-->
        <div class="accordion-section">
          <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-2">Update Feature</a>
          <div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">
            <p>
              There would also be an update view that uses Active Directory to determine who is logged in.
              We can then use a select query with the logged-in user's ID as the target and 
                populate the model with the logged in users information.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are limitations to which fields users can update. 
              For instance, they can't change their start date, title, department, or several other values.
              For these values, we loaded them into labels.
              The values that we did allow them to update, such as the orginations they are involved in,
                any family members they wanted to list,
                or their education history,
                we loaded this information into textareas.
              This will allow the user to modify the content loaded.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we designed the layout for the body, 
                we created the textareas inside a using statement linked to the actionresult in our controller.
              This will allow us to submit the values as parameters into a stored procedure via the SqlCommand class
              supported in the .NET framework 4.5 and 4.6.
            </p>
            <p>
              For usability, 
                we also wanted to add a reset button to this page for when the user doesn't like the changed information 
                and wants to reclaim the original values.
              This was a simple addition.
              Since the fields were created in the using statement, we could reset the values without even reloading the page.
              When the reset button is pressed, we had a javascript script that would re-disabled the submit button.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another usability feature that we thought would help the user when updating their information is having the
                submit button initially disabled.
              Using a combination of javascript and the onchange event, we can detect when the user has modified the textarea's
                value and activate the button.
              This will help both the user and the server/database.
              The user will know that their changes have been submitted because the button will no longer be clickable.
              The server will be happy because the user can't continuously mash the submit button,
                and the DB will be happy because it won't constantly receive update queries with the same information.
            </p>

        <div class="accordion-section">
          <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-3">Customized Phonelist Feature</a>
          <div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">
            <p>
              The third main feature we would be creating is the customized phonelist. 
              Using Active Directory, we can determine the logged in user, 
                query the DB for said user's personlized phonelist, 
                and display it in a useful format.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creating the phonelist structure in the DB was actually quite simple.
              It consisted of a two columns, one being the logged in user's ID,
                and the other being the target's ID.
              We load this into a model, and set bool value phonelistLoaded = true.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the user adds or removes someone from the phonelist, we can set the bool back to false and reload it.
              This will allow us to limit the number of queries we send to the database 
              as well as save memory by avoiding duplicating information.
            </p>
            <p>
              When loading the view, an if statement will check the value of phonelistLoaded.
              If it's true, then we access the model for who's information we need to load.
              Else we have to requery for the phonelist structure.
            </p>
            <p>
              This phonelist structure is meaningless to the user though.
              Why would they want to see a long list of User IDs?
              They don't, but we will use that in a clever select statement to bring back the information of who is in their phonelist.
              We can use:
            </p>
            <pre>
              SELECT (pertinent information) 
              FROM ContactInfoTable 
                INNER JOIN Phonelist 
                ON ContactInfoTable.ContactID = Phonelist.LoggedInUser
              WHERE Phonelist.LoggedInUser = @LoggedInUser</pre>
            <p>
              This statement will bring back the information we want to display, 
                using the phonelist table and the @loggedInUser parameter to only get what we need.
            </p>
          </div><!--end .accordion-section-content-->
        </div><!--end .accordion-section-->
        <div class="accordion-section">
          <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-4">Admin Feature</a>
          <div id="accordion-4" class="accordion-section-content">
            <p>
              Similar to the "User Update" page and the personalized phonelist, we use Active Directory
                and display the admin link if said logged in user is classified as an admin.
              The admin view would be similar to the update view.
              It would have the same behavior as far as updating information,
                it would just be able to update all the fields,
                as well as upload a new profile image.
              </p>
              <p>
                When an admin uploads a new photo, 
                  I created a process that checks to see if the user already has a profile image.
                If they do, it will rename the old picture and 
                  include the date/time in the filename so support staff can keep track of the changes easier.
                Then it saves the new picture with the user's ID, and the day.month.hour.minute as the filename.
                I thought about having it save as the old profile picture's name.
              </p>
              <p>
                However giving it the old picture's name caused a problem with caching.
                When the page would reload, it would still be getting the same name for their profile picture
                  and then just access cache for the picture instead of using the new one.
                I could have disabled caching to force it to always get the new picture, but this would be very expensive in
                  terms of memory and time.
                Instead, I had it save as a different name.
                This will cause the web page to search for a new picture since the filename has changed.
                Then we just have to update the model with the new filename for when we send it back to the database.
              </p>
              <p>
                If they don't have profile picture, then the process is quite simple.
                Upload the picture to the server and save the filename in the model for the DB update statement.
              </p>
              <p>
              A feature that we also created for the administrator was adding a new record to the DB.
              So far, we have used the view to modify an existing record.
              I created the "Create New User" form in a using statement that was linked to the same ActionResult as the
                "Update Record" form, however the submit button would send back a different value, 
                causing an If statement to modify the behavior slightly.
              This will allow us to re-use a lot of code, which is always a good thing.
            </p>

      </div><!--end .accordion-->
      <p>
        One more important thing to note is that when using any SQL statements,
          passing the new information as parameters into stored procedures instead of appended SQL statements is vital.
        The benefits are two fold,
          it removes the possiblity of SQL injection 
          and gives the ability to maintain the statements outside the application.
        Parameterizing the input treats it as an entire string 
          instead of looking at it as individual characters.
        That way, if a devious person decides to use:
        <pre>; DROP TABLE Contacts</pre>
        If this statement were to be run as an appended statement,
          there goes all your information.
        However if we parameterize there input,
          They have now just saved or searched for a string that says "; DROP TABLE Contacts".
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to avoid SQL injection is using a "blacklist" set of words.
        This method isn't best practice because now someone named Addison can't create their user 
          because the keyword "add" has been blacklisted.
        Plus catching every blacklisted word is difficult,
          and if there are any updates to SQL methods, 
          you now have to update this blacklist with the new keywords.
