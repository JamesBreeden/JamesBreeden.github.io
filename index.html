        My name is James Breeden, an aspiring software developer in the Orlando, FL area. Currently I am working as an intern 
        in the Strategic Systems department at CNL Financial. It has been some of the best working experience I have ever 
        had and could ever ask for. Everyone there is very knowledgeable and are more than willing to share this knowledge
        with you.
      </p>

        Being an intern, I was expecting to be performing a lot of coffee runs and picking up lunch orders. That couldn't be any
        further from reality. Right out of the gate, it was set up the IDEs and jump right into an intern only project. To
        recreate CNL's Associate directory. There was a basic requirements document of what it had to do, and thats about it.
        Everything else was up to our discretion.
