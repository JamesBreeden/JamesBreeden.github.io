      <p>
        My name is James Breeden, an aspiring software developer in the Orlando, FL area. Currently I am working as an Intern 
        in the Strategic Systems Department at CNL Financial. It has been some of the best working experience I have ever 
        had and could ever ask for. Everyone there is very knowledgeable and are more than willing to share their experience
        with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being an intern, I was expecting to be performing a lot of coffee runs and picking up lunch orders. That couldn't be any
        further from reality. Right out of the gate, it was set up the IDEs and jump right into an intern only project. To
        recreate CNL's Associate Directory. There was a basic requirements document of what it had to do, and thats about it.
        Most decisions were up to our discretion. This was my primary project, but focus was often pulled away for side projects.
        There were also SharePoint updates to perform, where I had to update their current intranet website with new content.
        If that didn't seem daunting enough there was also additional side projects that would come up. Some were business 
        oriented and others were.... not so business oriented, but thats another story for another time.
      </p>
      <p>
        First off, the primary task; to recreate the Associate Directory. What does this mean? Basically, their current directory
        has an outdated interface, the pathing doesn't flow how a user would want, and the speed like it was a little lacking. 
        They wanted a streamlined application that had a more modern feel and had an intuitive flow to the interaction. 
        We decided to use MVC in Visual Studio 2013 to create their new SharePoint Application. 
        This will allow us to use a combination of C#, HTML5, Razor, and JavaScript/Jquery. In order 
        to enforce version control, we used Team Foundation Server, commonly known as TFS. Used SSMS2012 to maintain a
        sandbox database that contained our test information.
