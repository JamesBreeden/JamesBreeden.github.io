        My name is James Breeden, an aspiring software developer in the Orlando, FL area. Currently I am working as an Intern 
        in the Strategic Systems Department at CNL Financial. It has been some of the best working experience I have ever 
        had and could ever ask for. Everyone there is very knowledgeable and are more than willing to share their knowledge
        with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being an intern, I was expecting to be performing a lot of coffee runs and picking up lunch orders. That couldn't be any
        further from reality. Right out of the gate, it was set up the IDEs and jump right into an intern only project. To
        recreate CNL's Associate Directory. There was a basic requirements document of what it had to do, and thats about it.
        Most decisions were up to our discretion. This was my primary project, but focus was often pulled away for side projects.
        There were also SharePoint updates to perform, where I had to update their current intranet website with new content.
        If that didn't seem daunting enough there was also additional side projects that would come up. Some were business 
        oriented and others were.... not so business oriented, but thats another story for another time.
      </p>
      <p>
        First off, the primary task; to recreate the Associate Directory. What does this mean? Basically, their current directory
        had an outdated interface, and the speed felt even older. They wanted a more streamlined application that had a more modern
        feel and had a more intuitive interaction. We decided to use MVC in Visual Studio 2013 to create their new SharePoint 
        Application. This will allow us to use a combination of C#, HTML5, Razor, and JavaScript/Jquery. In order to enforce version
        control, we used Team Foundation Server, more commonly known as TFS.
