        Hi, my name is James Breeden, an aspiring software developer in the Orlando, Florida area. 
        Recently, I was working as an Intern in the Strategic Systems Department at CNL Inc. 
        It was some of the best working experience I have ever had and could ever ask for. 
        Everyone there was, and still is, very knowledgeable and are more than willing to share their experience with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an intern, I was expecting that I would be performing a lot of coffee runs and picking up lunch orders. 
        That couldn't be any further from reality. 
        Right out of the gate, it was set up the IDEs and jump into an intern only project,
          to recreate CNL's Associate Directory. 
        There were three of us creating the entire thing from scratch.
        There was a basic requirements document of how it needed to function, and that was about it.
        Most decisions were up to our discretion such as the look, feel, and layout. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This was my primary project, but if that didn't seem daunting enough, 
            focus was often pulled away for side projects and day to day operations.
        There were SharePoint updates, where I was given the opportunity to perform changes to the current intranet website. 
        There were also side projects such as creating an application for the CCT team to securely execute batch files 
            or making a golf putting practice target out of any resources around the office.
      </p>
